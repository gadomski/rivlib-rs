FFI wrappers around [Riegl's](http://www.riegl.com/) RiVLib, used to read `rxp` files, their compressed streaming point cloud format.
You need a copy of RiVLib, available from Riegl's website, to use this bindings.

This library comes with a very simple executable, `rivlib`, which can query some basic information about an `rxp` file.
